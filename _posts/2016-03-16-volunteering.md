I really care about those less fortunate than myself and found that serving on the board of Christians Against Poverty in Australia was a good way for me to use my skills to give something back. I was Chairman from 2006 - 2015 and will remain a Director from 2016 onwards. During this time the charity has more than doubled in size whilst headcount remained relatively flat, the budget is stable and the number of ordinary Australians being helped has quadrupled.

My way of helping the local community where I also focus of household debt relief and budget counseling is through me local church. At weekends you'll always find me at C3 Church Campbelltown.
